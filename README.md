AdMob Native Advanced Ads in a Feed
============================================
Native is a component-based ad format that gives publishers the freedom
to customize how ad assets like headlines and calls to action are
presented in their apps. By choosing fonts, colors, and other details
for themselves, publishers are able to create natural, unobtrusive ad
presentations that can add to a rich user experience.
